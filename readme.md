Vue Tunes
=========

A front-end application utilizing Vue.js and the iTunes API. Search your favorite songs or artists and then add different songs to your playlist! Your playlist is saved to localstorage, so it will be persistent if you return on the same device.

Drive everyone you know crazy by listening to the same 30-second clip of a song over and over again!
